# Mod Matrix — Parameter Guide

## What this controls

The Modulation Matrix routes any of 24 **sources** (LFOs, envelopes, controllers, etc.) to any of 132 **destinations** (oscillator pitch, filter cutoff, envelope times, FX parameters, etc.) with a bipolar depth. The DeepMind 12 provides **8 independent busses** — each bus is one source → destination → depth triple. Multiple busses can share the same source or destination, and mod busses can target other busses' depths for meta-modulation.

## Parameters

Each of the 8 slots (1–8) has three parameters. Slot *N* uses NRPNs `93 + (N-1)×3` through `95 + (N-1)×3`.

| Parameter (manual name)      | paramKey                    | NRPN       | Range   | What it does                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mod *N* Source               | `modMatrix.N.source`        | 93 + (N-1)×3 | 0–24  | Which signal drives the modulation (see Sources table below) |
| Mod *N* Destination          | `modMatrix.N.destination`   | 94 + (N-1)×3 | 0–132 | Which parameter is modulated (see Destinations table below)  |
| Mod *N* Depth                | `modMatrix.N.depth`         | 95 + (N-1)×3 | 0–255 | Bipolar depth: display -128 (raw 0) to +127 (raw 255). Raw 128 = 0 (no modulation). |

**Concrete NRPNs:**

| Slot | Source NRPN | Destination NRPN | Depth NRPN |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1    | 93          | 94                | 95         |
| 2    | 96          | 97                | 98         |
| 3    | 99          | 100               | 101        |
| 4    | 102         | 103               | 104        |
| 5    | 105         | 106               | 107        |
| 6    | 108         | 109               | 110        |
| 7    | 111         | 112               | 113        |
| 8    | 114         | 115               | 116        |

Replace *N* in paramKey with the slot number: `modMatrix.1.source`, `modMatrix.3.depth`, etc.

> FX parameter numbering is per-slot: for FX slot *S*, destination = 80 + (S-1)×12 + paramIndex. Which parameters are available depends on the loaded FX type — consult the [effects section](../effects.md) and its sub-files for per-type parameter lists.

## Value guidance

- **Source selection**: Use bipolar LFO sources (6–8) when you want the modulation to swing both ways (e.g., vibrato). Use unipolar LFO sources (16–17) when you only want the modulation to go in one direction (e.g., filter sweep that only opens). Use LFO Fade sources (18–19) to delay the onset of LFO modulation (e.g., vibrato that fades in after note attack). Use Note Num (12) for key-tracking effects. Use Note Vel (13) for velocity-sensitive modulation beyond the built-in velocity controls.

- **Depth encoding**: Raw 128 = no modulation (display 0). Raw 255 = maximum positive modulation (+127). Raw 0 = maximum negative/inverted modulation (-128). For subtle effects, keep depth within ±20 of center (raw 108–148). For dramatic effects, use ±60 or more.

- **Meta-modulation (destinations 73–80)**: You can route a source to control the depth of another mod bus. This is extremely powerful — for example, route Mod Wheel → Mod 1 Depth to give the player real-time control over how much vibrato LFO 1 applies to pitch. This effectively makes the mod matrix depth velocity-sensitive, aftertouch-sensitive, or controllable by any source.

- **FX modulation**: FX parameter destinations (81–132) allow real-time modulation of effect parameters. For example, use an LFO to modulate chorus rate, or use velocity to modulate reverb level. The specific parameter mapping depends on which FX type is loaded in each slot.

- **Common vs per-voice**: Most destinations are per-voice (each of the 12 voices is modulated independently). Destinations marked with `*` (64–72) are common to all voices — modulating them affects the entire sound uniformly. VCA All (59) affects all 12 voice amplifiers regardless of note state; VCA Active (60) only affects voices currently playing a note.

## Interactions

- Each bus is independent. Setting source to `None` (0) or destination to `None` (0) disables that bus.
- The 8 busses are additive — if multiple busses target the same destination, their contributions sum.
- Mod matrix modulation is applied **on top of** the static parameter value. For example, if VCF cutoff is set to 100 and a mod bus adds +50, the effective cutoff is 150 (clamped to range).
- Sources that reference LFO 1 / LFO 2 are affected by LFO rate, shape, sync, and delay settings. See [lfos.md](lfos.md).
- Envelope sources (9–11) output the current envelope level. The envelope shape is set in [envelopes.md](envelopes.md).
- `vca.envDepth` (NRPN 81) and `filter.envDepth` (NRPN 42) provide hardwired envelope-to-VCA and envelope-to-VCF modulation. The mod matrix can add additional envelope routing on top, or replace these if the hardwired controls are set to 0.
- Mod Wheel (source 2) is commonly pre-routed in factory patches. Check existing mod matrix state before adding new routings to avoid conflicts.
- CC X/Y/Z (sources 22–24) correspond to MIDI CCs 115, 116, 117 — useful for external controller mapping or DAW automation.

|-------------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Vibrato (manual control)      | Mod Wheel (2)  | OSC1+2 Pit (9)   | +30 to +60       |
| Filter sweep via LFO          | LFO 1 (7)     | VCF Freq (20)    | ±40 to ±80       |
| Velocity → filter brightness  | Note Vel (13)  | VCF Freq (20)    | +40 to +80       |
| Velocity → attack time        | Note Vel (13)  | All Attack (25)  | -40 to -80 (faster attack on harder hits) |
| Aftertouch → vibrato          | Pressure (5)   | OSC1+2 Pit (9)   | +20 to +50       |
| Key tracking → filter         | Note Num (12)  | VCF Freq (20)    | +40 to +80       |
| LFO fade-in vibrato           | LFO1 Fade (18) | OSC1+2 Pit (9)   | +30 to +60       |
| Mod wheel controls mod depth  | Mod Wheel (2)  | Mod 1 Dep (73)   | +80 to +127      |
| Per-voice stereo animation    | LFO 1 (7)     | VCA Pan (63)     | ±30 to ±60       |
