# Arpeggiator & Control Sequencer — Parameter Guide

> Source: DeepMind 12 Owner's Manual, §8.1 (pp. 40–58)

## What this controls

The ARP/SEQ section contains the **arpeggiator** (rhythmic note patterns
from held keys), the **control sequencer** (a step-based modulation source
routed via the mod matrix), and global clock / sync settings that also
govern LFO sync, envelope sync, and time-based FX. Chord and poly-chord
features are UI-only programming modes with no NRPN-addressable parameters.

|-------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| 0     | 1/2   | Half note                           |

| 12    | 1/48  | Thirty-second note triplets         |

### ARP Pattern system

Patterns overlay **velocity** and **gate time** per step onto the
arpeggiator notes. The pattern loops independently of the arp note cycle,
so using a different pattern length from the number of held notes creates
evolving variations.

- **Preset-1 … Preset-32** (values 1–32): factory patterns, read-only.
- **User-1 … User-32** (values 33–64): editable via the on-screen
  Pattern Editor (velocity per step, gate time per step, ties, length 1–32).
- **None** (value 0): no pattern — all steps use the panel gate time fader
  and played velocity.

## Parameters — Control Sequencer

The control sequencer is a **modulation source** (not a note sequencer).
Route it to any destination via the mod matrix using source "Ctrl Seq".
Each step value is bipolar.

| Parameter (manual name)       | paramKey                     | NRPN    | Range  | What it does                                         |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl Seq Enable               | `controlSeq.enabled`         | 117     | 0–1    | Off (0) / On (1)                                     |
| Ctrl Seq Clock Divider        | `controlSeq.clockDivider`    | 118     | 0–15   | Divides master BPM (see Ctrl Seq Clock table below)  |
| Ctrl Seq Length                | `controlSeq.length`          | 119     | 0–31   | 1 step (0) → 32 steps (31). Default: 5 (= 6 steps)  |
| Ctrl Seq Swing                | `controlSeq.swing`           | 120     | 0–25   | 50% (0) → 75% (25). Default: 0 (50%)                |
| Ctrl Seq Key/Loop             | `controlSeq.keySyncLoop`     | 121     | 0–2    | Loop On (0), Key Sync On (1), Loop & Key Sync On (2) |
| Ctrl Seq Slew Rate            | `controlSeq.slewRate`        | 122     | 0–255  | Transition smoothing: 0 = instant, 255 = full glide  |
| Ctrl Seq Step 1–32 Value      | `controlSeq.step.N.value`    | 123–154 | 0–255  | 0 = skip; 1–255 → bipolar −127…+127 (value − 128)   |

### Ctrl Seq Clock Divider values

The control sequencer has a wider range of clock divisions than the
arpeggiator (16 options vs 13):

| Value | Ratio | Description                         |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| 0     | 4     | Four whole notes                    |
| 1     | 3     | Three whole notes                   |
| 2     | 2     | Two whole notes                     |
| 3     | 1     | Whole note                          |
| 4     | 1/2   | Half note                           |
| 5     | 3/8   | Dotted quarter note                 |
| 6     | 1/3   | Half note triplets                  |
| 7     | 1/4   | Quarter note                        |

| 12    | 1/12  | Eighth note triplets                |
| 13    | 1/16  | Sixteenth note **(default)**        |
| 14    | 3/64  | Dotted thirty-second note           |
| 15    | 1/24  | Sixteenth note triplets             |
| 16    | 1/32  | Thirty-second note                  |

| 19    | 1/64  | Sixty-fourth note                   |

> Note: The NRPN range is 0–15 but the manual lists 20 entries. Values
> 0–15 are confirmed via NRPN; higher entries may require the on-screen
> menu. The table above maps the manual's ordering to NRPN value.

### Ctrl Seq Key/Loop modes

| Value | Mode            | Behaviour                                                   |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Loop On         | Loops continuously, does **not** restart on key press. Best when running alongside the arp with a different step count. |
| 1     | Key Sync On     | Restarts on key press, does **not** loop (plays once).      |
| 2     | Loop & Key Sync | Loops continuously **and** restarts on each key press.      |

### Ctrl Seq Step encoding

- Value **0** = step is skipped (produces no modulation output).
- Values **1–255** map to bipolar modulation: `output = value − 128`
  (so 1 = −127, 128 = 0, 255 = +127).
- The slew rate smooths transitions between steps. At 0 the output
  jumps instantly; at 255 it ramps slowly to the next value.

## ARP Settings (global clock / sync)

These are accessed via the third page of the ARP/SEQ EDIT menu
(§8.1.9). They affect the **master BPM clock** shared by arp, control
sequencer, LFO sync, envelope sync, and time-based FX.

| Parameter (manual name) | paramKey | NRPN | Range | What it does |
|-------------------------|----------|------|-------|--------------|
| Clock Source            | ??       | —    | 0–2   | Internal (0), MIDI Auto (1), USB Auto (2). Auto modes fall back to internal if no external clock present. Default: MIDI Auto. |
| Transmit Clock          | ??       | —    | 0–1   | Sends MIDI clock out when clock source is Internal. |
| ARP-to-MIDI             | ??       | —    | 0–1   | Sends arp note output to MIDI out for recording. Default: Off. |
| ARP-Params              | ??       | —    | 0–1   | Program (0): arp settings stored per-program. Global (1): arp settings persist across program changes. |

> are not yet mapped — they may be menu-only items without edit-buffer
> equivalents.

## Value guidance

- **arp.rate**: The fader maps linearly 0–255 to 20.0–275.0 BPM. Common
  values: ~100 (≈120 BPM), ~200 (≈220 BPM). Use TAP/HOLD switch on
  the panel to set BPM by tapping.
- **arp.gateTime**: 128 = half-step (default). Lower values give staccato;
  higher values give legato. Combined multiplicatively with per-step gate
  from the pattern editor: panel fader at max = full pattern gate, at
  mid = half of pattern gate.
- **arp.swing**: 0 = straight (50%). Set to ~16 for triplet feel (≈66%).
  25 = maximum swing (75%). Same applies to `controlSeq.swing`.
- **arp.octaves**: 0 = notes only in played octave. Higher values extend
  the arp cycle through additional octaves (up to 6).
- **controlSeq.slewRate**: 0 for rhythmic stepped modulation (S&H style).
  Higher values for smooth, evolving modulation (approaching LFO-like
  shapes). 255 for very slow glides between step values.
- **controlSeq.step.N.value**: To create a simple triangle wave over
  4 steps: set steps to 1, 128, 255, 128 (= −127, 0, +127, 0).

## Interactions

- `arp.rate` sets the **master BPM** — it also affects `controlSeq` timing,
  LFO rates when `lfo1.arpSeq.sync` or `lfo2.arpSeq.sync` is On, envelope
  rates when envelope BPM sync is enabled, and time-based FX parameters.
- `arp.clock` and `controlSeq.clockDivider` independently divide the
  same master BPM, so the arp and ctrl seq can run at different rates.
- The control sequencer appears as a **mod source** in the mod matrix
  (source name "Ctrl Seq"). It must be routed to a destination there to
  have any audible effect. It can also be used as an envelope trigger
  source (value 4 in envelope trigger mode).
- `arp.hold` mirrors the physical TAP/HOLD switch (long-press). Changes
  from either location are reflected in the other.
- When `arp.pattern` = None (0), the pattern editor has no effect and all
  steps use the panel gate-time fader value and played velocity.
- Chord and poly-chord features are **UI-only** — they are programmed
  interactively on the panel and stored in persistent memory, not in the
  program edit buffer. There are no NRPNs for chord programming.

## Sync timing reference

> Source: Appendix 2 — ARP/SEQ/LFO Sync Timing (p. 150)

The master BPM clock is divided by the following ratios for the ARP,
control sequencer, and LFOs (when Arp Sync is on). The pattern repeats
across all clock divider tables — straight notes, dotted notes, and
triplets interleave in groups of three.

| Ratio | Description                          | Type     |
|-------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| 1     | One bar (whole note)                 | Straight |
| 1/2   | Half note                            | Straight |
| 3/8   | Dotted quarter note                  | Dotted   |
| 1/3   | Third note (half note triplets)      | Triplet  |
| 1/4   | Quarter note                         | Straight |
| 3/16  | Dotted eighth note                   | Dotted   |
| 1/6   | Sixth note (quarter note triplets)   | Triplet  |
| 1/8   | Eighth note                          | Straight |
| 3/32  | Dotted sixteenth note                | Dotted   |
| 1/12  | Twelfth note (eighth note triplets)  | Triplet  |
| 1/16  | Sixteenth note                       | Straight |
| 3/64  | Dotted thirty-second note            | Dotted   |
| 1/24  | Twenty-fourth (sixteenth triplets)   | Triplet  |
| 1/32  | Thirty-second note                   | Straight |
| 3/128 | Dotted sixty-fourth note             | Dotted   |
| 1/48  | Forty-eighth (thirty-second triplets)| Triplet  |
| 1/64  | Sixty-fourth note                    | Straight |
