  Quick-reference guide for DeepMind 12 parameters, organized by synth area.
  Read the relevant section before calling set_param / set_params to
  understand what a parameter does, what values make sense, and what other
  parameters you should consider setting alongside it.

## How to use this skill

When you need to set one or more DeepMind 12 parameters:

1. Identify which synth area the parameter belongs to (oscillators, filter,
   envelopes, etc.) from the table below.
2. Read that section file for parameter details, value guidance, and
   interactions.
3. Set the parameter(s) with `set_param` or `set_params` using the
   `paramKey` from the section's Parameters table.

If you're designing a specific type of sound, check the "Sound recipes"
section at the bottom for which sections to read together.

## Non-obvious parameter interactions

Things that don't work the way you'd assume from generic synth knowledge.
Read [recipes.md](sections/recipes.md) for full examples with values.

| Technique | Key params | Why it matters | Read |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|------|
| Envelope loop mode | `env.*.triggerMode` = 3 | ADR cycles as complex LFO; asymmetric curves → shapes no LFO can make | [envelopes](sections/envelopes.md) |
| Sustain slope | `env.*.sustainCurve` ≠ 128 | Sustain is NOT flat — <128 falls, >128 rises while key held | [envelopes](sections/envelopes.md) |
| Keyboard → envelope curves | Note Number → SusCurve/EnvDepth via mod matrix | Envelope *shape* changes across keyboard, not just pitch/filter | [mod-matrix](sections/mod-matrix.md) |
| Envelope → OSC 2 level | VCA Env → OSC2 Lvl via mod matrix | Oscillator crossfade tied to note lifecycle | [mod-matrix](sections/mod-matrix.md) |
| Fixed-offset portamento | `portamento.mode` 6–13 | Every note slides from fixed interval — pitch transients, not glides | [voice-config](sections/voice-config.md) |
| Tone mod + envelope | Env → TMod Depth via mod matrix | FM-like attack transients without FM; tone mod is DeepMind-unique | [oscillators](sections/oscillators.md) |
| Pressure → LFO rate | Pressure → LFO Rate via mod matrix | Aftertouch changes modulation *speed*, not just depth | [mod-matrix](sections/mod-matrix.md) |
| Mod wheel → FX params | Mod Wheel → dest 115/119 via mod matrix | Real-time performance control over effect character | [mod-matrix](sections/mod-matrix.md) |
| LFO delay staging | `lfo*.delayTime` | First 40% silent, then fade-in; stagger LFO 1 vs 2 for layered onset | [lfos](sections/lfos.md) |
| Self-oscillating filter tracking | `filter.keyTracking` = 255 + high resonance | Filter becomes pitch-accurate 3rd oscillator across keyboard | [filter](sections/filter.md) |
